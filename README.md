In this repo we show you some basic scenarios using the REST specification. 
Although most people are using the term REST or RESTful API just to indicate they do data transfer over HTTP, 
and  ignore the "Hypermedia as the engine of application State (HATEOS)" part of REST. 

The technology is used a lot lately to connect the front-end with the back-end.

For those who are not familiar with Jakarta EE, this repo should give you an indication how to create such a REST API with Jakarta EE 9 and JDK 11.
